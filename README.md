## What is Codon?

Codon is a high-performance Python implementation that compiles to native machine code without
any runtime overhead. Typical speedups over vanilla Python are on the order of 10-100x or more, on
a single thread. Codon's performance is typically on par with (and sometimes better than) that of
C/C++. Unlike Python, Codon supports native multithreading, which can lead to speedups many times
higher still.

*Think of Codon as Python reimagined for static, ahead-of-time compilation, built from the ground
up with best possible performance in mind.*

### Goals

- :bulb: **No learning curve:** Be as close to CPython as possible in terms of syntax, semantics and libraries
- :rocket: **Top-notch performance:** At *least* on par with low-level languages like C, C++ or Rust
- :computer: **Hardware support:** Full, seamless support for parallelism, multithreading (no GIL!), GPU and more
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Optimizations:** Comprehensive optimization framework that can target high-level Python constructs
  and libraries
- :battery: **Interoperability:** Full interoperability with Python's ecosystem of packages and libraries

### Non-goals

- :x: *Drop-in replacement for CPython:* Codon is not a drop-in replacement for CPython. There are some
  aspects of Python that are not suitable for static compilation â€” we don't support these in Codon.
  There are ways to use Codon in larger Python codebases via its [JIT decorator](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/decorator)
  or [Python extension backend](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/pyext). See also
  [*"Differences with Python"*](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/general/differences) in the docs.

- :x: *New syntax and language constructs:* We try to avoid adding new syntax, keywords or other language
  features as much as possible. While Codon does add some new syntax in a couple places (e.g. to express
  parallelism), we try to make it as familiar and intuitive as possible.

## Install

Pre-built binaries for Linux (x86_64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64) are available alongside [each release](https://github.com/exaloop/codon/releases).
Download and install with:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://exaloop.io/install.sh)"
```

Or you can [build from source](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/advanced/build).

## Examples

Codon is a Python-compatible language, and many Python programs will work with few if any modifications:

```python
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()
fib(1000)
```

The `codon` compiler has a number of options and modes:

```bash
# compile and run the program
codon run fib.py
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987

# compile and run the program with optimizations enabled
codon run -release fib.py
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987

# compile to executable with optimizations enabled
codon build -release -exe fib.py
./fib
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987

# compile to LLVM IR file with optimizations enabled
codon build -release -llvm fib.py
# outputs file fib.ll
```

See [the docs](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/general/intro) for more options and examples.

This prime counting example showcases Codon's [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) support, enabled with the addition of one line.
The `@par` annotation tells the compiler to parallelize the following `for`-loop, in this case using a dynamic schedule, chunk size
of 100, and 16 threads.

```python
from sys import argv

def is_prime(n):
    factors = 0
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors += 1
    return factors == 0

limit = int(argv[1])
total = 0

@par(schedule='dynamic', chunk_size=100, num_threads=16)
for i in range(2, limit):
    if is_prime(i):
        total += 1

print(total)
```

Codon supports writing and executing GPU kernels. Here's an example that computes the
[Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set):

```python
import gpu

MAX    = 1000  # maximum Mandelbrot iterations
N      = 4096  # width and height of image
pixels = [0 for _ in range(N * N)]

def scale(x, a, b):
    return a + (x/N)*(b - a)

@gpu.kernel
def mandelbrot(pixels):
    idx = (gpu.block.x * gpu.block.dim.x) + gpu.thread.x
    i, j = divmod(idx, N)
    c = complex(scale(j, -2.00, 0.47), scale(i, -1.12, 1.12))
    z = 0j
    iteration = 0

    while abs(z) <= 2 and iteration < MAX:
        z = z**2 + c
        iteration += 1

    pixels[idx] = int(255 * iteration/MAX)

mandelbrot(pixels, grid=(N*N)//1024, block=1024)
```

GPU programming can also be done using the `@par` syntax with `@par(gpu=True)`.

## What isn't Codon?

While Codon supports nearly all of Python's syntax, it is not a drop-in replacement, and large codebases might require modifications
to be run through the Codon compiler. For example, some of Python's modules are not yet implemented within Codon, and a few of Python's
dynamic features are disallowed. The Codon compiler produces detailed error messages to help identify and resolve any incompatibilities.

Codon can be used within larger Python codebases via the [`@codon.jit` decorator](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/decorator).
Plain Python functions and libraries can also be called from within Codon via
[Python interoperability](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon/interoperability/python).
